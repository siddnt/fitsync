so now the whole website which you are seeing, now i have to change this to a react based website - using same backend but frontend will be react,Redux, Redux Forms,
Redux Actions, hooks that we use in react. also the whole website purpose is already shifting from “courses” to the gym marketplace — there are no course pages or schedules any more. the active roles are trainees, trainers, gym owners, and sellers. gym owners list their gyms, trainees search for gyms, view details, and purchase monthly subscriptions, while trainers work inside a gym with their assigned trainees. so there will be lot of files to be completely deleted and lot of new files to be created. but color scheme should remain same. and there should be perfect use of react, not just returning same html pages in react components. also use redux for state management wherever necessary. use hooks where ever necessary. so i am proving you the zip of my whole current project here, and i want you to guide me thorugh how to do this whole things on my own with taking help from gpt also. so i want step by step guide promts to do this whole. 
below i am providing you the details of the changes which i want in the website - (kind of brief documetation of changes required) - 

so basiclly, the user will register as a trainee, trainer, gym owner, seller. then owner can list thier gyms, and trainee can search for gyms and buy monthly subscriptions of those gyms, trainer can register themself in a gym as trainer, and seller can sell their products in the marketplace. and trianer in a gym where a trainer is enrolled in the this gym under that trainer, and then the trainer will mark his present absent, progress of that trainee, diet plan for next week, trainer can give feedback to trainee, basically these things are getting updated for trainee by trainer, and these things are  displayed in trainee dashboard. and these options should be there to be displayed in trainer , wehre he can select whose assigned trainee he wants to see and update these details- progress, diet plan, attendance, feedback etc.

instead there will be gym owners , and they will be able to list thier gyms, and the normal user - trainee , will be able to serach thier gym, and can buy thier monthly subscirptions, so basically there will be no courses, no schedules , courses related modules, pages, routes, controllers, routes etcc... instead thier there should be all the things for gym owners. so , as i am having courses option on the navbar(at the top of website), so instead of showing courses there, we will show listed gyms there, along with their gym owners, and now whenever the user will click on the left side(on any listed gym), the whole details of that gym will be displayed on the right, which will include the photo, monthly pricing details, gymowner name, gym location, contact details of gym, opening closing times, working days of weeek, etc(some additional things that which should be included in your opiniion).
also there will be review, gallary, which should be displayed below any gym, and the reviews or rating or gallary phtos will be given only by a user who is registered in that gym currently. and these things which we are displaying there, will be taken from gym owners at the time they were reigtering their gym, aslo include a optional thing named key features, so that they can include some more unique salient features of their gym like - ac, water, kitchenm, etc, etc. and this will also be displayed there in the above told page.

as there are gym owners, first they have to register themselfves in the website as gym owners, and now there will be a page for them take the monty subsricption(some x amount to geneerate a gym), and then reigter their gym(after taking all of the inputs - princing , gym name, location, etc etc), and now after registering the gym , their should be an options for gym owners to edit the detaionls of their gym, along with pricing(so that there will be mrp , and discounted price would be showing up), etc.their is also an option for gymowners - sponsorship, they can get it on some price, and it will help their gym to show up above(in the page of all gym listed pages), with a tag indicated below on that it is sponsored(below on the left on gym listed page, wheere gym listed. (this way we can show the sponsored gyms on top of list of all gyms).

now revenue model is updated, revenue for the admin or overall website will come from monltyl subsction of listing gym by gym owners, means, gym owners will pay subscription to list their gym, if they are listing two of their gyms(may be two or more gyms in two diff locations or more locations) they have to pay subsciptions for each of them, so from here the revenue will come. also there are mainly three sources to get the revenue from - a. the revenue getting from gym owner after they take subsciton to list their gym. b. from marketplace(as before, we are not changing it).
c. the revenue getting from sponsorship(i explained how).

user dashboards -> profile picture(photos of user) , basic informations(like , sex, age, location, weight height etc), the gym in which you are enrolled, the subsription deadline ,the purchase history from market, orders , and option to repay from there itself, and if anything which is neccessay to be shown, you can think of and add it .

gym owner -> profile picture(photos of user) , basic informations(like , sex, age, location, etc), the gyms he has listed, number of impressions on a perticular gym(count++ when some user click on that gym from the page where all the gyms were listed), a single line plot grph using red color to denote the amount he is paying to admin every month and green denote his earnings from the user enrolling to his gyms, recent users joined to his gyms, a histogram to show the age of users enrolled, a piechart showing male and female enrolled. recent activities(phtos uploaded, review rating for his that perticular gym), and if anything which is neccessay to be shown, you can think of and add it .

. admin dashboard -> profile picture(photos of user) , basic informations(like , sex, age, location, etc), total number of - users, gym owners , gyms. recent activity(some user joing some gym, some gym that got listed , some gym owner listed etc), line graph showing weekly or monthy(toggle options between weekly and monty) earning, single grpah should be having multiple options - toggle between weekly and motnyl , also options like selection one or multiple mutiple streams of income(gym listing, sponsorship , masrketplace).

locatoins on india map by showing dots(density of gyms on that perticular area of map), piechart showing rations between diff sources of revence , sex of users enrolled, historgram for age distribution, and if anything which is neccessay to be shown, you can think of and add it. (keep those previous things of message notifictaion, messages came from feedback), remove that approval thing (used previsly to approve some new trainer), bcz now the gym owner will be approved by default when he will take the subscription and list his gym, so no need of that approval thing. make the options for admin to delete any user, gym owner, gym etc.
